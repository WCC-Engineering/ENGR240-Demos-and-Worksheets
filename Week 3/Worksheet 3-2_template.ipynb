        "\n",
        "SciPy's `root_scalar` function with the Brentq method is a powerful tool for finding roots of nonlinear equations. The Brentq method is a robust bracketing method that combines the reliability of bisection with the efficiency of inverse quadratic interpolation.\n",
        "\n",
        "### How the Brentq Method Works\n",
        "\n",
        "The Brentq method is a bracketing method, which means it requires an initial interval [a, b] that contains the root (i.e., f(a) and f(b) have opposite signs). It then iteratively narrows down this interval until a root is found within the specified tolerance. The key advantages of Brentq are:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. It's guaranteed to converge if there's a root in the initial bracket\n",
        "2. It combines the reliability of bisection with faster convergence strategies\n",
        "3. It doesn't require derivative information\n",
        "\n",
        "### Basic Syntax and Parameters\n",
        "\n",
        "The basic syntax of `root_scalar` with the Brentq method is:\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "result = optimize.root_scalar(func, method='brentq', bracket=[a, b], xtol=1e-8, ...)\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "Where:\n",
        "- `func` is the function to find the roots of\n",
        "- `method='brentq'` specifies we want to use the Brentq method\n",
        "- `bracket=[a, b]` is the interval containing the root\n",
        "- `xtol` is the relative error tolerance\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Algorithm Parameters vs. Function Parameters\n",
        "\n",
        "It's important to distinguish between two types of parameters:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Algorithm parameters** - These control how `root_scalar` operates, such as:\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   # Example of adjusting algorithm parameters\n",
        "   result = optimize.root_scalar(func, method='brentq', bracket=[a, b], xtol=1e-10, maxiter=1000, full_output=True)\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "   \n",
        "2. **Function parameters** - These are passed to your function to evaluate it (what this worksheet focuses on):\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   # Example of passing parameters to your function using a lambda\n",
        "   def my_func(x, a, b, c):\n",
        "       return x**2 + a*x + b - c\n",
        "       \n",
        "   # These parameters (5, 3, 10) are passed to my_func as a, b, c via the lambda function\n",
        "   result = optimize.root_scalar(lambda x: my_func(x, 5, 3, 10), method='brentq', bracket=[0, 5])\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "#### When to Use Different Parameter Passing Approaches\n",
        "\n",
        "For this worksheet, we'll explore parameter passing strategies that provide flexibility and maintainability. Lambda functions are particularly useful with `root_scalar` because they allow you to:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Use keyword arguments**: Lambda functions make it easy to use keyword arguments (`S0=`, `vm=`, etc.) which are more readable.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Avoid parameter order dependency**: With lambdas, you can manage the parameter order explicitly.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Handle changing parameters in loops**: When solving for many different parameter combinations (like our time loop), lambdas make it easy to update only the parameters that change.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Improve readability**: Lambda functions make the code's intent clearer, especially when only some parameters change while others remain fixed.\n",

        "In this worksheet, we've explored how to handle parameters in root-finding problems using the Newton-Raphson method and `scipy.optimize.root_scalar` with the Brentq method. We've also examined the concept of residuals in numerical approximations and compared the efficiency and accuracy of different approaches.\n",

        "Key takeaways:\n",
        "1. Parameter passing in numerical methods can be handled through function arguments or keyword arguments\n",
        "2. Lambda functions provide a clean way to parameterize functions for `root_scalar`\n",
        "3. Residuals help us understand the accuracy of our numerical solutions\n",
        "4. The Newton-Raphson method requires derivative information but may converge faster when derivatives are simple\n",
        "5. The Brentq method is a robust bracketing method that doesn't require derivatives but needs a bracket containing the root\n",
        "6. For complex problems, specialized libraries like SciPy offer robust and efficient solutions\n"
