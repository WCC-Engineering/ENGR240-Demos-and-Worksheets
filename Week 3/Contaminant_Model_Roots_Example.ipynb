    "This notebook demonstrates how we can reformulate a problem as a roots problem and then use the bisection method to find the solution. We'll revisit the contaminant decay model from Week 1 but solve a slightly different problem.\n",

    "### Learning Objectives\n",
    "- Understand how to reformulate problems as root-finding problems\n",

    "- Visualize the relationship between model parameters and solutions\n",

    "From the plot, we can observe the relationship between the decay rate of contaminant B ($k_B$) and the time it takes for the total concentration to reach the regulatory standard of 10 ppm.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key observations:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. As $k_B$ increases, the time to reach the standard decreases. This makes sense because a higher decay rate means faster breakdown of the contaminant.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The relationship is non-linear - we see diminishing returns as $k_B$ increases. This is important for decision-making: increasing the decay rate (perhaps through active treatment) may be very beneficial up to a point, after which further increases yield minimal time savings.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The curve approaches an asymptote, suggesting that even with very high values of $k_B$, there's a minimum time required to reach the standard. This is because contaminant A has a fixed decay rate in our model, and it eventually becomes the limiting factor.\n",
    "\n",
    "This type of analysis is valuable for environmental remediation planning, helping engineers decide whether active treatment to increase decay rates is worth the investment, or if natural attenuation (with lower decay rates) is sufficient given time constraints."
