    "With the 10×10 matrix, we should see a much clearer performance difference between the methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Method 1**: Our naive implementation performs the full O(n³) Gaussian elimination process for each system, with pure Python loops (which are slow).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Method 2**: We explicitly perform LU factorization once (an O(n³) operation), and then use it to solve each system with only O(n²) operations. The implementation is optimized C/Fortran code in SciPy.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Method 3**: NumPy's `linalg.solve` uses optimized LAPACK routines that perform LU decomposition internally for each system. While it's recalculating the decomposition each time (O(n³)), the underlying implementation is highly optimized in compiled code, making it much faster than our Python implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the 10×10 matrix, the advantage of explicit LU factorization (Method 2) over naive Gaussian elimination (Method 1) should be substantial. The comparison with Method 3 will be interesting - it will likely be much faster than Method 1 but still slower than Method 2 since it recomputes the factorization for each right-hand side."

    "## Discussion\n",
    "\n",
    "### Computational Efficiency\n",
    "\n",
    "The results clearly demonstrate the efficiency of using LU factorization when solving multiple linear systems with the same coefficient matrix but different right-hand sides. Here's why:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Naive Gaussian Elimination (Method 1)**: For each new right-hand side, we perform the full O(n³) elimination process. With a 10×10 matrix, this becomes quite expensive, especially in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **LU Factorization (Method 2)**: We perform LU factorization once (an O(n³) operation), but for each new right-hand side, we only need to perform forward and backward substitution (each an O(n²) operation). This gives us a theoretical speedup of O(n) for many right-hand sides.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **NumPy's linalg.solve (Method 3)**: While it uses optimized LAPACK routines under the hood (which use LU decomposition), it recalculates the decomposition for each right-hand side. Its speed comes from being implemented in highly-optimized compiled code.\n",
    "\n",
    "For solving multiple systems with the same coefficient matrix, explicitly factoring the matrix once and reusing it (Method 2) is theoretically and practically more efficient. The advantage becomes more pronounced with larger matrices and more systems to solve, as we've seen with the 10×10 example.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Math Behind LU Factorization\n",
    "\n",
    "LU factorization decomposes a matrix A into a product of a lower triangular matrix L and an upper triangular matrix U:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$A = LU$$\n",
    "\n",
    "When partial pivoting is used (which is typical for numerical stability), we have:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$PA = LU$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where P is a permutation matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "To solve the system $Ax = b$, we:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Compute the LU factorization $PA = LU$\n",
    "2. Solve $Ly = Pb$ using forward substitution\n",
    "3. Solve $Ux = y$ using backward substitution\n",
    "\n",
    "### Applications\n",
    "\n",
    "This technique is valuable in many engineering applications, such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Finite element analysis with multiple load cases\n",
    "- Circuit analysis with multiple sources\n",
    "- Parameter sensitivity studies (as demonstrated in this worksheet)\n",
    "- Control system analysis with varying inputs\n",
    "- Implicit time integration schemes\n",
    "- Monte Carlo simulations\n",
    "\n",
    "### Implementation in Scientific Computing\n",
    "\n",
    "In real scientific computing applications, libraries like SciPy provide specialized functions like `lu_factor` and `lu_solve` precisely because reusing matrix factorizations is so important for performance. Always look for these opportunities in your numerical code!"
