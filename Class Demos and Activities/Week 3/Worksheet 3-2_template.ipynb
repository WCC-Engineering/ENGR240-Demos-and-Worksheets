        "\n",
        "The `fsolve` function is designed to solve systems of nonlinear equations. Its algorithm works as follows:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. It approximates the Jacobian matrix (which contains derivatives) using finite differences\n",
        "2. Uses this approximation to determine a search direction\n",

        "### Basic Syntax and Parameters\n",
        "\n",
        "The basic syntax of `fsolve` is:\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "result = optimize.fsolve(func, x0, args=(), xtol=1e-08, maxfev=0, ...)\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "Where:\n",
        "- `func` is the function to find the roots of\n",
        "- `x0` is the initial guess\n",
        "- `args` is a tuple of arguments that will be passed to the function (this is for passing parameters to evaluate your function, not algorithm parameters)\n",
        "- `xtol` is the relative error tolerance (an algorithm parameter)\n",
        "- `maxfev` is the maximum number of function evaluations (an algorithm parameter)\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Algorithm Parameters vs. Function Parameters\n",
        "\n",
        "It's important to distinguish between two types of parameters:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Algorithm parameters** - These control how `fsolve` operates, such as:\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   # Example of adjusting algorithm parameters\n",
        "   result = optimize.fsolve(func, x0, xtol=1e-10, maxfev=1000, full_output=True)\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "   \n",
        "2. **Function parameters** - These are passed to your function to evaluate it (what this worksheet focuses on):\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   # Example of passing parameters to your function\n",
        "   def my_func(x, a, b, c):\n",
        "       return x**2 + a*x + b - c\n",
        "       \n",
        "   # These parameters (5, 3, 10) are passed to my_func as a, b, c\n",
        "   result = optimize.fsolve(my_func, x0=1.0, args=(5, 3, 10))\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "#### When to Use args vs. Alternative Parameter Passing Approaches\n",
        "\n",
        "You might wonder: If `args` can pass parameters to our function, why explore more complex approaches?\n",
        "\n",
        "The `args` parameter in `fsolve` provides a simple way to pass parameters:\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "# Using args for parameter passing\n",
        "result = optimize.fsolve(my_func, x0=1.0, args=(5, 3, 10))\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "However, there are several reasons to consider alternative approaches:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Keyword vs. positional arguments**: The `args` approach only passes positional arguments. Our MM function uses keyword arguments (`S0=`, `vm=`, etc.) which are more readable.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Parameter order dependency**: With `args`, you must maintain the exact parameter order as defined in the function signature.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Changing parameters in loops**: When solving for many different parameter combinations (like our time loop), rebuilding the `args` tuple each time can be cumbersome.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Readability**: Lambda functions and wrappers can make the code's intent clearer, especially when only some parameters change while others remain fixed.\n",
        "\n",
        "For this worksheet, we'll explore alternative parameter passing strategies that provide more flexibility and maintainability.\n",
