        "\n",
        "A differential equation system is **stiff** when it contains processes operating on vastly different time scales. In our chemical reaction system:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Fast process**: The reaction $B + C \\rightarrow$ products with rate constant $k_3 = 125$ (or 5000 in Task 5)\n",

        "The key to understanding stiffness lies in the **Jacobian matrix** of our ODE system. The Jacobian is NOT a property of the numerical method—it's a property of the differential equation system itself.\n",

        "- **Net result**: Far fewer steps needed, so much more efficient overall\n",
        "\n",
        "### The Efficiency Mathematics\n",

        "From your observations, the efficiency advantage comes from:\n",

        "- Required step size: $h \\approx \\frac{2.8}{|\\lambda_{max}|}$\n",
