        "General Linear Least Squares (GLLS) is a powerful technique for fitting nonlinear models that can be transformed into linear form. In this worksheet, we'll implement this method in Python using NumPy's `np.linalg.lstsq()` function, applying it to a thermistor calibration problem.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Learning Objectives\n",
        "- Understand the principles of General Linear Least Squares\n",
        "- Transform nonlinear models into linear form\n",
        "- Implement GLLS using NumPy's `np.linalg.lstsq()` function\n",

        "\n",
        "### The Thermistor Calibration Problem\n",
        "\n",
        "Thermistors are temperature-sensing resistors that change resistance with temperature. The relationship between temperature and resistance is nonlinear, but can be modeled using the Steinhart-Hart equation:\n",
        "\n",
        "$$\\frac{1}{T} = A + B\\ln(R) + C[\\ln(R)]^3$$\n",
        "\n",
        "Where:\n",
        "- $T$ is the temperature in Kelvin (or Celsius for our purposes)\n",
        "- $R$ is the resistance in ohms\n",
        "- $A$, $B$, and $C$ are coefficients specific to the thermistor\n",
        "\n",
        "Our goal is to determine the coefficients $A$, $B$, and $C$ that provide the best fit to experimental data.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Understanding General Linear Least Squares (GLLS)\n",
        "\n",
        "GLLS is used to fit models of the form:\n",
        "\n",
        "$$y = \\sum_{j=1}^{m} c_j Z_j(x)$$\n",
        "\n",
        "Where:\n",
        "- $y$ is the dependent variable (possibly transformed)\n",
        "- $x$ is the independent variable\n",
        "- $Z_j(x)$ are basis functions\n",
        "- $c_j$ are the coefficients we want to determine\n",
        "\n",
        "The key insight of GLLS is that while the relationship between $x$ and $y$ might be nonlinear, the relationship between the transformed variables $Z_j(x)$ and a transformation of $y$ can be linear. This allows us to use standard linear least squares techniques.\n",
        "\n",
        "The steps for implementing GLLS are:\n",
        "1. Transform the model into a linear form\n",
        "2. Define the basis functions $Z_j(x)$\n",
        "3. Set up the Z matrix (each column corresponds to a basis function evaluated at all data points)\n",
        "4. Solve the system using linear least squares\n",
        "5. Evaluate the quality of the fit"
