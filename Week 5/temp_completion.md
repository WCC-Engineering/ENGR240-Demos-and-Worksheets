### 5.2 Discussion Questions

Answer the following questions based on your observations:

1. **Method Comparison**: How do the results of the three methods compare? Which method(s) produced the best fit (highest RÂ², lowest Syx)?

2. **Linear Transformation Limitations**: What are the potential limitations or drawbacks of using a linear transformation for nonlinear models? Why might the nonlinear methods perform better?

3. **Curve_fit vs. Minimize**: Compare the implementations of `curve_fit` and `minimize`. What are the advantages of using `curve_fit` over `minimize`? Why might you still want to use `minimize` in some scenarios?

4. **Parameter Uncertainty**: Only the `curve_fit` method provided uncertainty estimates for the parameters (standard deviations). Why is parameter uncertainty important, and how might you use this information?

5. **Identical Results**: You may have noticed that methods 2 and 3 (minimize and curve_fit) produced identical or nearly identical results. Why do you think this is the case? (Hint: consider the relationship between the two functions in scipy.optimize)

### 5.3 When to Use Each Method

Based on your experience in this worksheet, complete the table below by filling in the advantages and disadvantages of each curve fitting method:

| Method | Advantages | Disadvantages | When to Use |
|--------|------------|---------------|-------------|
| Linear Regression on Transformed Data | | | |
| Nonlinear Regression using minimize | | | |
| Nonlinear Regression using curve_fit | | | |

### 5.4 Application to Real-World Problems

Nonlinear regression is used extensively in various fields of science and engineering. For each of the following models, indicate which fitting approach you would use and why:

1. **Michaelis-Menten Enzyme Kinetics**: $v = \frac{V_{max} \cdot [S]}{K_m + [S]}$ (reaction velocity vs. substrate concentration)

2. **Exponential Decay**: $N(t) = N_0 e^{-\lambda t}$ (radioactive decay, population decline)

3. **Sigmoidal Dose-Response**: $R = \frac{R_{max}}{1 + (\frac{EC_{50}}{C})^n}$ (drug response vs. concentration)

## Conclusion

In this worksheet, we explored three different approaches to fit nonlinear models to data. We applied these techniques to a bacterial growth rate model and compared their results and implementation complexity.

The key takeaways are:
- Linear transformation can provide a simple approach but may not always yield the best fit
- Direct nonlinear optimization techniques often provide better fits for nonlinear models
- `curve_fit` offers the same optimization power as `minimize` but with a more convenient interface and additional benefits like parameter uncertainty estimation

These methods are fundamental tools for analyzing experimental data in engineering and science, where many relationships are inherently nonlinear.
