# Project 1: Converging-Diverging Nozzle Flow Analysis

## Objectives
- Formulate and solve roots problems
- Determine the appropriate algorithm and numerical parameters for accuracy and efficiency
- Develop effective figures for communicating numerical results

## Problem Statement
Converging-diverging nozzles are required to accelerate a gas to velocities greater than the speed of sound. They are a standard component in aircraft and spacecraft propulsion systems.

For supersonic one-dimensional idealized gas flow (isentropic) in a converging-diverging nozzle, the relationship between the nozzle cross-sectional area, A, and the Mach number, M is given by:

$\frac{A}{A^*} = \frac{1}{M}\left[\left(\frac{2}{k+1}\right)\left(1+\frac{k-1}{2}M^2\right)\right]^{\frac{k+1}{2(k-1)}}$

Where A* is the area at the throat used to normalize A into the dimensionless area. The parameter k is the specific heat ratio for the gas. Two values of M exist for each value of the normalized area - one value less than 1 (subsonic flow) and one value greater than 1 (supersonic flow).

## Instructions
Open the accompanying Python notebook in Google Colab to complete this project. The notebook contains minimal starter code and a guide to help you solve the problem.

You are required to solve for both M results (subsonic and supersonic) for values of A/A* ranging from 1.1 to 10.0 (note that M = 1 when A/A* = 1) and for representative values of k including:
- k = 1.285 (COâ‚‚)
- k = 1.400 (Air)
- k = 1.667 (noble gasses)

## Deliverables
Submit your completed Google Colab notebook with:
1. Working code implementing your solution
2. Results presented graphically in the notebook
3. Discussion section answering all the required questions
