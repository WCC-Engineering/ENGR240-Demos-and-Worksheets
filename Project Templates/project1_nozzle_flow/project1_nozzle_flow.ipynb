        "Converging-diverging nozzles are required to accelerate a gas to velocities greater than the speed of sound. They are a standard component in aircraft and spacecraft propulsion systems. The figure below shows a schematic of a nozzle with a graph indicating the behavior of the velocity (blue curve), temperature (red curve), and pressure (green curve) of a gas as it moves through the nozzle.\n",

Two values of M exist for each value of the normalized area, $\\hat{A}$, one value less than 1 (subsonic flow) and one value greater than 1 (supersonic flow).\n",
