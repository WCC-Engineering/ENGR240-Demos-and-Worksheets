        "After completing this worksheet, answer the following questions:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. How do conditional statements help you model different physical phenomena in engineering problems?\n",
        "\n",
        "   **Answer**: Conditional statements allow us to implement different mathematical models or equations for different regimes or scenarios in engineering problems. In fluid dynamics, as seen in this worksheet, different physical equations apply to different flow regimes (laminar, transitional, turbulent). Conditional statements let us select the appropriate model based on calculated parameters like the Reynolds number. This approach mirrors how engineers approach real-world problems, where different physical laws apply under different conditions.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. What are the benefits of breaking down a complex analysis into separate functions vs. having one large function that does everything?\n",
        "\n",
        "   **Answer**: Breaking down complex analysis into separate functions offers numerous benefits:\n",
        "   - **Modularity**: Each function handles a specific task, making the code easier to understand and maintain\n",
        "   - **Reusability**: Individual functions can be reused in other analyses or projects\n",
        "   - **Testability**: Smaller functions are easier to test individually, ensuring correctness\n",
        "   - **Readability**: Code becomes more self-documenting when function names clearly describe their purpose\n",
        "   - **Collaboration**: Different team members can work on different functions simultaneously\n",
        "   - **Debugging**: Errors are easier to locate and fix in smaller functions\n",
        "   \n",
        "   In our pipe flow analysis, breaking it down into reynolds number calculation, flow regime classification, friction factor calculation, and pressure drop calculation made the code much more manageable and aligned with how engineers conceptually approach the problem.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. How would you modify the code to handle a different fluid or pipe material? What changes would be needed?\n",
        "\n",
        "   **Answer**: Our modular design makes these modifications straightforward:\n",
        "   - For a different fluid, we would just need to change the input parameters: `kinematic_viscosity` and `density` to match the new fluid properties\n",
        "   - For a different pipe material, we would need to use the appropriate relative roughness value for that material\n",
        "   \n",
        "   No changes to the core functions would be needed. For example, to analyze air flow through a steel pipe, we would simply update the input parameters:\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   air_viscosity = 1.48e-5  # m²/s at 20°C\n",
        "   air_density = 1.2  # kg/m³ at 20°C\n",
        "   steel_pipe_roughness = 0.00092  # relative roughness for a 50mm steel pipe\n",
        "   \n",
        "   # Then use these values in our calculations\n",
        "   reynolds = calculate_reynolds(velocity, pipe_diameter, air_viscosity)\n",
        "   friction = calculate_friction_factor(reynolds, steel_pipe_roughness)\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "   This flexibility demonstrates the power of our modular design and parameterized functions.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. How did using lambda functions for mathematical formulas improve (or not improve) your code's readability and maintainability?\n",
        "\n",
        "   **Answer**: Lambda functions significantly improved the code's readability and maintainability by:\n",
        "   - Keeping mathematical formulas concise and in a format that closely resembles their mathematical notation\n",
        "   - Separating the formula definitions from the conditional logic that selects which formula to use\n",
        "   - Making the code more self-documenting, as each lambda function clearly represents a specific equation (e.g., laminar_f, blasius_f, haaland_f)\n",
        "   \n",
        "   The one-line nature of lambda functions is perfectly suited for these relatively simple mathematical formulas. For more complex calculations with multiple steps, regular named functions would be more appropriate. In this specific case, lambda functions provided an elegant solution that improved code organization without sacrificing clarity."
