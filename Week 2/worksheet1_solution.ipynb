        "\n",
        "   **Answer**: We initialize the arrays with zeros to pre-allocate memory for all N elements. This is more efficient than appending elements to empty arrays, which would require reallocating memory with each append operation. Pre-allocation also allows us to access any element by index, which is necessary for the loop to work.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. What would happen if we changed the loop to start from 0 instead of 1? What adjustments would we need to make to the code?\n",
        "\n",
        "   **Answer**: If we changed the loop to start from 0, we would be re-calculating the first element that we've already set before the loop. We would need to remove the separate initialization of the first term and adjust the formula to `series_vector[k] = 1/(2**(k+1))` to maintain the same mathematical sequence.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. The formula for the sum of an infinite geometric series with first term a and common ratio r (where |r| < 1) is:\n",
        "   $$S_{\\infty} = \\frac{a}{1-r}$$\n",
        "   Calculate the theoretical sum for our series and compare it to the value of `sums[N-1]` for large N. How close does our numerical calculation get to the theoretical value?\n",
        "   \n",
        "   **Answer**: For our series, a = 1/2 and r = 1/2. Thus, the theoretical sum is:\n",
        "   $$S_{\\infty} = \\frac{1/2}{1-1/2} = \\frac{1/2}{1/2} = 1$$\n",
        "   \n",
        "   For N = 20, we get a numerical sum of approximately 0.9999990463. The difference is about 0.0000009537, showing our calculation is very close to the theoretical value of 1."

        "\n",
        "   **Answer**: The geometric series converges much faster than the Leibniz series. After just 20 terms, the geometric series gets within about 10^-6 of its limit, while the Leibniz series is still off by about 0.01 from Ï€ after 100 terms. This is because the terms in the geometric series decrease exponentially (by a factor of 1/2 each time), while the terms in the Leibniz series decrease only as 1/n, which is much slower.\n",
