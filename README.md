# Class Demos and Activities

This folder contains demos and activities used during class sessions to introduce and practice key concepts in Python and numerical methods.

Each notebook is designed to be interactive and help students develop their programming and problem-solving skills.

## Public Availability

These materials (excluding solution files) are automatically synchronized to the public repository at [WCC-Engineering/ENGR240-Demos-and-Worksheets](https://github.com/WCC-Engineering/ENGR240-Demos-and-Worksheets).

## Instructor Solutions

All solution files (notebooks with "solution" in the filename) have been moved to the `/Solutions` directory at the root of this repository. These files are not synchronized to the public repository.

## Workflow

When adding new worksheets or activities:
1. Place template files and demo notebooks in this folder
2. Place solution files in the `/Solutions` folder with matching week structure
