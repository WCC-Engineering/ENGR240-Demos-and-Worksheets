        "\n",
        "2. **Decay rate impact**: As $k_B$ increases, the overall concentration decreases more rapidly. This makes intuitive sense - a higher decay rate means faster breakdown of the contaminant.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Compliance timeline**: The dashed line represents a regulatory standard of 10 ppm. We can see that different values of $k_B$ result in different times to reach this standard:\n",
        "   - With $k_B = 0.5$ (slowest decay), it takes longest to reach the standard\n",
        "   - With $k_B = 5$ (fastest decay), it takes the least time\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Long-term behavior**: As time increases, the curves begin to converge. This occurs because contaminant B eventually decays to negligible levels regardless of $k_B$, and the long-term behavior becomes dominated by contaminant A (which has a constant decay rate in all scenarios).\n",
        "\n",
