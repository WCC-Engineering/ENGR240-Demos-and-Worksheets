        "\n",
        "In many engineering applications, we need to interpolate between discrete data points to create a smooth, continuous representation that approximates underlying behavior. Splines are piecewise polynomial functions that provide smooth interpolation between data points and are widely used in engineering design, data analysis, and computer graphics.\n",

        "## Theoretical Background: Spline Interpolation\n",
        "\n",
        "### What is a Spline?\n",
        "\n",
        "A spline is a piecewise polynomial function that smoothly connects a set of data points. The term \"spline\" originated from the flexible drafting tools used by shipbuilders and draftsmen to draw smooth curves through a set of points.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Cubic Splines\n",
        "\n",
        "Cubic splines are particularly popular because they provide a good balance between smoothness and computational efficiency. A cubic spline consists of third-degree polynomial segments connecting pairs of data points, where the polynomials are constrained to ensure the resulting curve is continuous and smooth.\n",
        "\n",
        "For a set of data points $(x_0, y_0), (x_1, y_1), \\ldots, (x_n, y_n)$ where $x_0 < x_1 < \\ldots < x_n$, a cubic spline $S(x)$ is defined as:\n",
        "\n",
        "$$S(x) = S_i(x) \\quad \\text{for } x_i \\leq x \\leq x_{i+1}, i = 0, 1, \\ldots, n-1$$\n",
        "\n",
        "where each $S_i(x)$ is a cubic polynomial of the form:\n",
        "\n",
        "$$S_i(x) = a_i + b_i(x-x_i) + c_i(x-x_i)^2 + d_i(x-x_i)^3$$\n",
        "\n",
        "The coefficients $a_i$, $b_i$, $c_i$, and $d_i$ are determined by enforcing the following constraints:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Interpolation**: The spline passes through all data points\n",
        "   - $S_i(x_i) = y_i$\n",
        "   - $S_i(x_{i+1}) = y_{i+1}$\n",
        "   \n",
        "2. **Continuity**: The first and second derivatives are continuous at interior knots\n",
        "   - $S_i'(x_{i+1}) = S_{i+1}'(x_{i+1})$\n",
        "   - $S_i''(x_{i+1}) = S_{i+1}''(x_{i+1})$\n",
        "\n",
        "### End Conditions\n",
        "\n",
        "The constraints above give us $4n - 2$ equations for $4n$ unknown coefficients. To fully determine the spline, we need two additional conditions, typically specified at the endpoints. Common end conditions include:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Natural Spline**: Second derivatives at endpoints are set to zero\n",
        "   - $S''(x_0) = S''(x_n) = 0$\n",
        "   \n",
        "2. **Clamped Spline**: First derivatives at endpoints are specified\n",
        "   - $S'(x_0) = f'_0$ and $S'(x_n) = f'_n$\n",
        "   \n",
        "3. **Not-a-knot**: Third derivative is continuous at the second and second-to-last points\n",
        "   - $S_0'''(x_1) = S_1'''(x_1)$\n",
        "   - $S_{n-2}'''(x_{n-1}) = S_{n-1}'''(x_{n-1})$\n",
        "   \n",
        "4. **Periodic**: Function and derivatives at endpoints match (for cyclic data)\n",
        "   - $S^{(k)}(x_0) = S^{(k)}(x_n)$ for $k = 0, 1, 2$\n",
